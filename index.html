<h2>WEB</h2>
Why do we use it?
It is a long established fact that a reader 
will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout.
The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal 
distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', 
making it look like readable English. 
Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors 
now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, 
and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy.
